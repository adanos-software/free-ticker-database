## Top Review Batches

| Field | Gap Class | Exchange | Rows | Recommended Next Source | Source Gate |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| official_reference_gap | official_reference_unmatched_source_gap | OTC | 3110 | Fresh official exchange directory, scoped alias review, or source-of-truth decision. | Require an active official reference match for the listing key, or a documented blocker/out-of-scope decision. |
| missing_sector_stock | official_industry_taxonomy_unavailable_gap | FSX | 784 | Implemented official venue source layer; residual row needs a stronger official taxonomy/detail source. | Keep stock_sector blank until an official taxonomy source exposes a canonical mappable industry value. |
| missing_sector_stock | otc_sector_source_gap | OTC | 554 | SEC SIC, issuer filings, OTCMarkets profile, or reviewed secondary company profile. | Canonical stock sector only after exchange/name gate; no ticker/name-only inference. |

- Future fills must pass the row-level source gate and the normal reviewed override path.
- The database validator fails if current gaps are missing from this classification report or if stale classifications remain.
