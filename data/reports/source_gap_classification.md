## Top Review Batches

| Field | Gap Class | Exchange | Rows | Recommended Next Source | Source Gate |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| official_reference_gap | official_reference_unmatched_source_gap | OTC | 3108 | Fresh official exchange directory, scoped alias review, or source-of-truth decision. | Require an active official reference match for the listing key, or a documented blocker/out-of-scope decision. |
| missing_sector_stock | official_industry_taxonomy_unavailable_gap | FSX | 784 | Implemented official venue source layer; residual row needs a stronger official taxonomy/detail source. | Keep stock_sector blank until an official taxonomy source exposes a canonical mappable industry value. |

## Release Policy

- No value in this report is an inferred metadata fill.
- Future fills must pass the row-level source gate and the normal reviewed override path.
- The database validator fails if current gaps are missing from this classification report or if stale classifications remain.
